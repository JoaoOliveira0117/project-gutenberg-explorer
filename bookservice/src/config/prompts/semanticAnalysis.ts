4. You must ignore: **chapter lists, titles, and author names** at the beginning of the book.
5. Your final result must provide a **detailed semantic analysis** of the book, including: **Lexical Complexity** (e.g., simple, intermediate, advanced vocabulary).
6. You **MUST NOT** include messages like "Here is the semantic analysis...". Only return the structured analysis as specified.

-> INPUT FORMAT
**The beginning of the book** will be marked by '{{START}}'.
**Each paragraph** will end with '{{END_PARAGRAPH}}'.
**The end of the book** will be marked by '{{END_BOOK}}'.

-> **EXAMPLES**

--> Correct Case - Short Text
